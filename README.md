## AirBnB clone - The console

An Airbnb clone console project typically involves creating a command-line interface (CLI) that mimics some functionalities of Airbnb. The command interpreter serves as the interface through which users can interact with the system. It allows users to perform various operations like managing listings, users, bookings, etc., similar to how one might interact with Airbnb's platform.
